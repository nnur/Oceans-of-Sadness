# Oceans-of-Sadness
*A unity game about an old man at sea with a teacup hat.*


I created this game with my friend Dylan ( [github.com/dharness](https://github.com/dharness) )
at Hack the North hosted by Waterloo university.

It was the most fun and sleep deprived hackathon ever! Also the judges thought we were hilarious.
For one, we were the only hackers there geared up with watercolour paint.
