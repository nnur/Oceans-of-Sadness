# Oceans-of-Sadness
*A unity game about an old man at sea with a teacup hat.*


I created this game with my friend Dylan ( [github.com/dharness](https://github.com/dharness) )
at Hack the North hosted by Waterloo university. 
We combined our skills in art, software and storytelling to create something truly unique and creative.

Hack the North was one of the best hackathons I've had the priviledge of attending. Also the judges loved us.
For one, we were the only hackers there geared up with watercolour paint.
